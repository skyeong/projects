    "This dataset is presently only one of four on Kaggle with information on the rising risk of digital financial fraud, emphasizing the difficulty in obtaining such data. The main technical challenge it posses to predicting fraud is the highly imbalanced distribution between positive and negative classes in 6 million rows of data. Another strumbling block to the utility of this data stems from the possible discrepancies in its description. The goal of this analysis is to solve both these issues by a detailed data exploration and cleaning followed by choosing a suitable machine-learning algorithm to deal with the skew. I show that an optimal solution based on feature-engineering and extreme gradient-boosted decision trees yields an enhanced predictive power of 0.997, as measured by the area under the precision-recal curve. Crucially, these results were obtianed without artificial balancing of the data making this approach suitable to real-world applications. "

Remarkable, the number of fraudulent TRANSFERs almost equals the number of fraudulent CASH_OUTs (see the right half of the plot in section 5.1). These observations appear, at frst, to bear out the description provided on Kaggle for the modus operandi of fraudulent transactions in this dataset, namely, fraud is committed by first transferring out funds to another account which subsequently cashes it out. We will return to this issue later in section 2.4."
